## Mysql Employee Tracker

I created a employee tracker using mysql. To use this employee tracker all you have to do is login to your mysql account in the terminal then seed the data in the db folder, and use node on the index.js. Using the arrow keys you can select: All employees, Add employee, Update employe role, All roles, Add roles, All departments and Add departments. There is link to a video that goes in depth into all the choices.
